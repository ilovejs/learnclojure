# Introduction to surfchase

Surfchase is a program that simulates a surfer trying to find the best waves. Given a set of beaches, decide which beach will be the best for the surfer. After initial setup, send 100 surf events, which will update the initial data, and after each event the surfer will have to decide where to go, based on the most promising surf event.

So, for one round, load the initial data, then decide where to go. That is the intermediate goal.
